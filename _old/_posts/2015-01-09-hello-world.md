The first post in my new life as a Ruby on Rails developer!

I've been toying with building a website for some time. I'm using Ruby on Rails, because it seemed like the easiest way to build everything from scratch and get something up and running quickly. While at the same time, offering more options going forward, than your average Wordpress installation would.

This blog is meant to be documentation for me, but also a way to learn more about what I'm doing, by writing about it. I'm terrible at remembering code, and why this work and that didn't work. Writing it down will help me in two ways.

And if anybody drops by, and learns any thing - or has comments for me - that'll just be a bonus.
