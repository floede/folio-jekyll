I had been interested in doing more than just HTML and CSS for a while, and when I got an idea for a serious website I wanted to build, it seemed like the time was right.

Some time before, I had read about Ruby on Rails, and how it makes it easy to create a website from the ground up. I had just not gotten around to actually trying it out. I didn't really have a reason to, as I've been working on Windows based platforms my whole career.

I started reading a few simple guides, and took some online courses like Rails for Zombies and . Subscribed to /r/ruby and /r/rails.
