I had been interested in doing more than just HTML and CSS for a while, and when I got an idea for a serious website I wanted to build, it seemed like the time was right.

Some time before, I had read about Ruby on Rails, and how it makes it easy to create a website from the ground up. I had just not gotten around to actually trying it out. I didn't really have a reason to, as I've been working on Windows based platforms my whole career.

I started reading a few simple guides, and took some online courses like [Rails for Zombies](http://railsforzombies.org/) and [tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org/). Subscribed to [/r/ruby](http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby) and [/r/rails](http://www.reddit.com/r/rails). I read quite a lot of [Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/), which both amused and annoyed me with it's quirkey sillyness.

It didn't really teach me a whole lot. I'm probably not a programmer, and I have no understanding of what makes Ruby better than other languages. Or not. Making small code examples with math or logic that differs slightly in syntax from Javascript, but otherwise does nothing, teaches me nothing.
I need to make actual projects, to make things stick in my mind.

Then, because I was looking for ways to get into Ruby on Rails, and because [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com) was the new hotness, I came across the [Learn Ruby on Rails](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/909377477/learn-ruby-on-rails) book project from [Daniel Kehoe](https://twitter.com/rails_apps).

[Then when the book came](http://learn-rails.com/learn-ruby-on-rails.html), I read through it first, and then I started coding. That was a year ago.
And suddenly I had functioning Rails code running on my computer. Now I have a real website running on a server, with a sign up form and simple functionality.

I'm pretty sure, that without Daniel's book. I would never have made it this far. Not only do I return to it regularly, to look up details, but it also taught me basic things about developing web sites that I didn't know, even after working with it for 15 years.
