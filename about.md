<p class="message">
  My name is Janus Hasseriis. I've been working as what we used to a webdesigner, but is now more often referred to as a front end developer, since 1999.
</p>

I've started this blog to write about my experiences while I try to learn Ruby on Rails by building a new website with serious intentions.
I'm thinking it'll serve as both a reference for myself, but also help me remember the solutions I find.
If anybody else finds it useful. That's a bonus.

On Twitter you can find me as: [@floede](https://twitter.com/floede).
